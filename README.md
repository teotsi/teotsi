### Hi there 👋

I'm Thodoris, a full stack developer and CS enthusiast, with a knack for (cool) maths. Based in Athens, Greece 🇬🇷 . Currently a student (soon to be graduate 🎓) at AUEB.

I've worked with Python 🐍, JavaScript (Node, Vue & React), Java (vanilla and Spring Boot 🍃), between others. Always looking for cool new tech, APIs and frameworks to explore!

For more, check out my [Github Pages website](https://teotsi.github.io/). Feel free to contribute to any project!
